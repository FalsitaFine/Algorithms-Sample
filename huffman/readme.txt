The code has been tested with sampleinput on CSEL-KH1250-34



usage: bash run.sh inputfilename(or ./run.sh inputfilename)
put the inputfile in the same direction with the code(and .sh),
then type bash run.sh,
the program will give out an output.txt

Here I assumed that all things contains in the inputfile is "a" to "z", and the format of the inputfile should be similar to the sample inputfile.
The output is in a same order like the sample output, as the traversal method is similar.

Thank you for reading!
Have a good day!
