The code has been tested with sampleinput on CSEL-KH1250-34


usage: bash run.sh inputfilename(or ./run.sh inputfilename)
put the inputfile in the same direction with the code(and .sh),
then type bash run.sh,
the program will give out an output.txt


I used an ArrayList of Node(which contains name and rank) to solve the problem.
ArrayList is flexible, but as my method for reading the txt file need a fixed space, I assume that the input file will not contain more than 32768 pairs(of name and rank).
The format of the inputfile should be similar to the sample input file.

And I have put another method to solve this problem as comment in the end of the code,
it is a Lab from CSCI1913, nearly same with this question, but in a different structure.

Thank you for reading!
Have a good day!
