The code has been tested with sampleinput on CSEL-KH1250-34



usage: bash run.sh inputfilename(or ./run.sh inputfilename)
put the inputfile in the same direction with the code(and .sh),
then type bash run.sh,
the program will give out an output.txt

Here I assumed that the index of number you want to find could not be less than 0 or larger than the size of the input array, which will make the program meaningless.


Thank you for reading!
Have a good day!
